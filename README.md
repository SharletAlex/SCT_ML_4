Overview
This project aims to build a robust and accurate hand gesture recognition model using deep learning techniques. The model uses a dataset of labeled hand gestures and is trained to classify gestures in real-time or static images with high accuracy.

Features
Real-time hand gesture classification
Support for a wide range of gestures
Built-in functionality for expanding with additional gestures
Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/hand-gesture-recognition.git
cd hand-gesture-recognition
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Preparation: Organize and load your gesture data according to the specified format.
Training: Run the notebook or scripts to train the model.
Inference: Use the trained model to recognize gestures in new images or real-time video feed.
Data
The dataset used for this project includes a set of labeled hand gesture images. Each image corresponds to a unique gesture. The data is preprocessed to standardize image size and format.

Model
The model is built using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification. Key steps:

Data Augmentation: To increase the model's robustness, various transformations (rotation, scaling) are applied.
Training: The model is trained with categorical cross-entropy loss.
Evaluation: Accuracy and loss metrics are used to assess model performance.
Evaluation
The model is evaluated on test data with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices and ROC curves are used to visualize performance across different gesture classes.
